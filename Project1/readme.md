# To do List
1. Implement Module
2. Change Test bench
3. Test!

## Notes
- The parameterization isnt going as planned.
    - There should be a value in the test bench that stores the value of bit to rearrange the whole circuit
- Too Much modules
    - There should be a way to compartmentalize each part of the circuit  but without making a bunch of modules
