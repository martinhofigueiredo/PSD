# Laboratory Project 1

3. Implementation

In the psddivide.v file we have written detailed comments in every relevant part of the code.

At first we used the gtkwave to debug and understand the values in every reg or wire. In a second fase we used Open DigitalJS to visualize the block diagram of the code implemented in the psddivide.v file. 

4. Verification 

We have adapted the Testbench in order to compute the error our circuit is calculating. We calculate the Absolute value between the "golden" simulator function and our result and display it as a percentual error of the calculation.

5. Additional developments
5.1 Parameterization
We used throughout the code parametrized values for the Number of bits in order for the code to be dinamic. We could switch from 32bit to 64bit easily.

5.2. Finite State Machine
We implemented the machine and verified that it is working to the best of our knowledge
